                Italian fashion house Prada was founded by Mario Prada in 1913. In collaboration with his brother
                Martino, the pair opened a leathergoods and luggage store called Fratelli Prada (Prada Brothers) in
                Milan. Mario's daughter Luisa took over the business from her father, and in turn, her daughter Miuccia
                Prada, would take over for her in 1978. The company as we know it today has evolved under Miuccia
                Prada's direction. </p>
            <p>
                Prada's first totes and backpacks were introduced in 1979, eventually becoming best-sellers. The company
                expanded its market by placing its handbags in major retailers around the world and opening a second
                boutique in Milan. Shoes were added to the line in 1984, and Prada's first line of womenswear debuted in
                1988. A womens' high-fashion line called Miu Miu (Miuccia's nickname) was introduced in 1992, and
                menswear was offered starting in 1993. </p>

                Estée Lauder Companies Inc. was founded in 1946 by Joseph and Estée Lauder. Ms. Lauder gained early
                experience in the skincare and cosmetics industry under the tutelage of her uncle, a chemist and skin
                care specialist. With a belief that every woman can be beautiful, and an initial focus on skin care, the
                company originally offered its products through door-to-door sales. The company opened its first
                department store counter in Saks Fifth Avenue, just two years later.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1953, the company introduced its first fragrance, Youth Dew, in the form of a bath oil that doubled
                as a perfume. Youth Dew continues to be a worldwide bestseller for the company. In 1964, the company
                launched Aramis, Inc., to produce prestige fragrance and grooming products for men. Over the years,
                Estée Lauder Companies Inc. would expand its offerings through the launch, acquisition or licensing
                agreements of multiple fragrance and cosmetics companies, with more than 25 companies in its portfolio
                today, including Clinique, Origins, Tom Ford, MAC and Jo Malone.</p>
